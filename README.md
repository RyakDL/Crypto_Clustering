Unsupervised Machine Learning

Overall Comment: I find machine learning to be extremely interesting and felt very confident with the coding. I did follow class activities and completed the assignment without a problem. I am looking forward to learning supervised learning as I am very interested in using both economic and demographic data to create predictive models as it applies to credit risk in banking.

  Comment: I used this code to check my work and found that while the data was exactly the same, the predictive values were slightly different. I assume that is because of the mathetical model behind PCA. They were not so different that it caused me to be concerned.
